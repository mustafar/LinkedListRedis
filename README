Linked List over Redis
======================

What is it?
-----------
- A linked list caching structure using Redis for storage
- in Python
- Big Os
	- Insert: O(1)
	- Read: O(n)
	- Delete: O(n)
- List grows on inserts and decays as keys expire. 
  The list shrinks when it is scanned to search for a key.
  All nodes encountered having an expired key are deleted.
  
Dependencies
------------
- Redis: http://redis.io/
- redis-py: https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py

Usage
-----
- Obj init: LinkedListRedis(url='localhost', port=6379)
- Set: obj.set (key, val, ttl=60sec)
- Get: obj.get (key)
- Delete: obj.dele (key)
- stats: obj.stats() - dumps some stats

This is a dumb project
----------------------
- because it is built over Redis which is O(1) everything
- who really needs a linked list?
